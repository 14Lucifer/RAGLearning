Aqualeo is a cloud-first company, utilizing a hybrid cloud architecture to deliver scalable, flexible, and secure IT services to its customers.
The company's cloud infrastructure is designed around a multi-cloud approach, leveraging AWS, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud for different workloads.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the foundation for Aqualeo's core services, including EC2 instances (c5.2xlarge), S3 storage (100 TB), and RDS (db.m5.large) for relational database management.
Azure is used for hosting machine learning workloads, with virtual machines (Standard_NC6) and Azure Blob Storage (200 TB) for big data analytics.
Alibaba Cloud powers the company's global operations with Elastic Compute Service (ECS) (e.g., ecs.g5.large) for running web applications and Elasticsearch for log management.
For networking, Aqualeo employs AWS Transit Gateway for inter-region connectivity and Azure ExpressRoute for private, high-throughput links between on-premises and cloud environments.
The company's cloud-native applications are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, with EKS on AWS and AKS on Azure.
Aqualeo uses Terraform and AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring repeatable and scalable cloud deployments.
Security is a key concern for Aqualeo, and the company implements a Zero Trust security model with strict identity and access management (IAM) policies, using AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory, and Alibaba Cloud RAM.
The company uses managed services for database, analytics, and AI to reduce operational overhead, with Amazon Aurora for high availability databases and Azure Synapse Analytics for big data processing.
For monitoring and observability, Aqualeo leverages Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics, CloudWatch for AWS logs, and Azure Monitor for performance metrics across environments.
Aqualeo’s CI/CD pipeline is powered by Jenkins for automated build and deployment, integrated with GitHub for source code management, and Azure DevOps for collaboration across teams.
The company employs a disaster recovery plan with multi-region backups on AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Alibaba Cloud OSS, ensuring data resiliency in case of failure.
Aqualeo’s compliance strategy includes data encryption at rest and in transit, along with regular security audits to meet industry standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
By using a multi-cloud strategy, Aqualeo is able to optimize cost, enhance performance, and ensure redundancy across its infrastructure, catering to the specific needs of its diverse customer base.
